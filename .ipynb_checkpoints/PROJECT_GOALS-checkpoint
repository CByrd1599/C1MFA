This git repository will be used to upload code and other files for the Carbon Flux project.
What we know/have done as of starting this repository:
1. Can use the Python package mfapy to model carbon flux in metabolic pathways. Obtained from research article
2. Know what reactions and pathways we are interested in and their chemistries
3. Have created this git repository to keep track of changes and have a central place to upload code

What our goals are for this project:
1. Create code that models the carbon fluxes along a metabolic pathway
2. Write a report in Latex about our project

Making this change through Git bash.

To Do List:
1. Made Github Repository - DONE
2. Read through and understand mfapy code - Both work on by end of Tuesday
3. Begin Latex Report, requested premium subscription - DONE
4. Recreate toy models from paper - Both work on by end of Tuesday
5. Try adding a metabolite or reaction to the metabolic model - Wed/Thurs
6. Try using own 13C labelling data and own metabolic model to get fluxes - Wed/Thurs
7. Look at confidence intervals, metabolite sensitivities.
8. Write up results, make powerpoint -- by Dec 6th
